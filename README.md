# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to analyze and predict airline passenger satisfaction. It identifies key service parameters that influence satisfaction and classifies passengers as satisfied or dissatisfied.

## Project Structure
- **airline-passenger-satisfaction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **data**: Folder containing **train.csv** and **test.csv** datasets.

## Dataset
The dataset includes passenger details and ratings on:
- **Flight Distance, Class, and Travel Type**
- **Inflight Entertainment, Seat Comfort, Food & Drink Quality**
- **Departure and Arrival Delays**
- **Customer Satisfaction Labels**: Satisfied/Neutral or Dissatisfied

## Objectives
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand key factors influencing satisfaction.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Identify significant predictors.
3. **Model Building:** Train machine learning models to predict satisfaction.
4. **Evaluation & Insights:** Analyze model performance and derive actionable insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning model development
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Analysis and visualization
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
